Maat is a framework that mines VirusTotal scan reports to extract various information about the correctness, completeness, and consistency of scanners. It can also be used to train threshold-based and ML-based labeling strategies to label (Android) apps according to their VirusTotal scan reports and much more. Maat also refers to the ancient Egyptian concepts of truth, balance, order, harmony.
